# Fridge List

A groceries tracking app!

Keep track of what is in your fridge, freezer, and pantry, then as you make your groceries list you can reference your other lists so you know what you need! Also, when you're at the store and you have an idea but can't remember what you have on hand at the house, since you are already looking at your groceries list, just hit that back button and check out what you've got in stock! Easy! No more trying to call and get your 9 year old to tell you if you have feta cheese in the fridge, just to bring a package home to find a whole tub sitting there on the second shelf.

## Instructions

* Lists are stored locally so if you are shopping with your phone, tablet, etc., you must use that device to make out your lists, or when you get to the store, they won't be there!
